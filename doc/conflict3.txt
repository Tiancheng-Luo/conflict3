INTRODUCTION                                                      *conflict3*

conflict3 is a collection of tools for resolving merge conflicts produced by
revision control systems. It defines commands for highlighting parts of a
conflict that have changed, and commands for automatically resolving a
conflict, partially or fully.

conflict3 does not directly interact with revision control systems. Instead,
it operates on a file containing diff3-style conflict markers.

==============================================================================
SETUP                                                       *conflict3-setup*

In order to use conflict3 with your revision control system,  you need to
configure your revision control system to leave diff3-style conflict markers in
files.

If you are a git user, you can do so with the following command: >

	git config --global merge.conflictstyle diff3

It is suggested that you map some of the conflict3 commands to easy-to-type
keystrokes, because you will be using them a lot while working on conflicts.
For example, I have the following lines in my .vimrc: >

	nnoremap <Leader>c :Conflict3Highlight<CR>
	nnoremap <Leader>r :Conflict3ResolveAll \| Conflict3Shrink!<CR>

CONCEPTS                                                 *conflict3-concepts*


In this document, the three section in a diff3-style conflict are called
"local", "base" and "remote", from top to bottom.

conflict3 employs one particular approach to conflict resolution:
resolution through simplification. Each step of resolution transforms the
conflict into another simpler, smaller conflict, while preserving validity
of the conflict. Such a step may either be performed by a command provided
by conflict3, or done by the user using usual editing abilities of Vim.
When the conflict becomes empty, the resolution process is complete.

Specifically, a part of a conflict is resolved by modifying the conflict
so that all three versions contain the same text in that part. Lines
that are the same among all three versions can be moved out of the conflict,
across the top and bottom boundaries.

If you are using conflict3 only for highlighting, you are of course free
to resolve conflicts in whatever way you want. However, in the rest of
this document, I will assume the above-mentioned approach.

Microhunk ~
                                                       *microhunk* *microhunks*
"Microhunks" are the smallest units of conflict parts which conflict3 commands
may deal with. They are roughly defined to be contiguous blocks of non-trivial
diffs, but a precise definition is yet to be specified. A microhunk can be
either character-level or line-level. A character-level microhunk fits within
one line, and a line-level microhunk spans zero or more full lines.

Current conflict ~

The "current conflict" is the conflict containing the cursor, or the next
conflict if there is none.

COMMANDS                                                 *conflict3-commands*

:Conflict3Highlight                                     *:Conflict3Highlight*
                        Apply diff-based highlighting to the current conflict.
                        See |conflict3-highlights| for a list of highlight groups
                        used.

:Conflict3Clear                                             *:Conflict3Clear*
                        Clear all highlighting in the current window.

:Conflict3ResolveOne                                   *:Conflict3ResolveOne*
                        Resolve the next |microhunk| in the current conflict
                        that can be automatically resolved.

:Conflict3ResolveAll                                   *:Conflict3ResolveAll*
                        Automatically resolve as many |microhunks| in the
                        conflict as possible.

:Conflict3TakeLocal                                     *:Conflict3TakeLocal*
:Conflict3TakeBase                                       *:Conflict3TakeBase*
:Conflict3TakeRemote                                   *:Conflict3TakeRemote*
                        Resolve the next |microhunk| by taking the local,
                        base, or remote version, respectively.

:Conflict3TakeThis                                       *:Conflict3TakeThis*
                        Resolve the next |microhunk| by taking the version the
                        cursor is in.

:Conflict3Shrink[!]                                        *:Conflict3Shrink*
                        Move as many lines of text out of the current conflict
                        as possible. If [!] is used, remove the conflict
                        completely when an empty conflict would result.

CONFIGURATION VARIABLES                                    *conflict3-config*

                                               *g:conflict3_highlight_method*
g:conflict3_highlight_method
          Specifies which method conflict3 should use for highlighting text.
          The following values are valid:

              "match"   Use the |matchaddpos()| function. Highlights are
                        per-window, and are cleared when the buffer is hidden.
                        Default for Vim.
              "nvim"    Use the NeoVim API. Highlights are per-buffer, and are
                        automatically updated when lines are added/removed
                        above them. Default for NeoVim.
              "null"    Don't perform any highliting.
